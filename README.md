Objectives:
1. Use High Performance Linpack and other common benchmarks to explore fundamental concepts in parallel computing:
   * Strong scaling & Amdahl’s law
   * Weak scaling & Gustafson's law
   * Theoretical performance & efficiency
   * “Memory wall” and arithmetic intensity
   * Bandwidth & latency
2. Gain practical experience with parallel computing software and tools:
   * MPI & OpenMP
   * BLAS libraries
   * Linux perf counters
3. Understand the impact of system and processor architecture on performance:
   * P-states
   * Hyperthreading
   * NUMA
   * SSE/FMA instructions
   * Processor cache hierarchy
